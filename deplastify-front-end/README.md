Welcome to DePlastify!

DePlastify is an app to help clean up our beaches and keep them free of trash. We will use NASA's grounded Ocean Drifter data to locate the beaches that likely have the most concentration of trash. Using this data, we can inform the user of higher at risk sites so they can plan their events accordingly. DePlastify will give the user the option to add their own site that needs a pickup. The user will then be able to use their location to create an event at their site to inform other users that their help is needed. Users can then report their pickup to show how much trash they collected and inspire others to do the same.  Deplastify will use the power of social media to raise awareness and bring people together to keep our beaches clean.
